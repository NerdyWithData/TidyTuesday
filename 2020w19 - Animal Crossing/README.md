I just started re-learning R last week (thanks to DataCamp) and this is
my first \#TidyTuesday challenge, exploring Animal Crossing data. I
decided to look at the user reviews to see what users liked and did not
like about the game. Interestingly, you’ll see even the positive reviews
have similar criticisms.

In this one challenge, I learned the following:

✔️ Breaking down text into individual words <br /> ✔️ Identifying
adjectives vs other word types <br /> ✔️ Obtaining the sentiment of
words <br /> ✔️ Plotting text as a scatter without overlap <br /> ✔️ How
to create a ridgeline plot <br /> ✔️ How to plot multiple charts on the
sameview <br /> ✔️ Countless formatting tricks <br />
